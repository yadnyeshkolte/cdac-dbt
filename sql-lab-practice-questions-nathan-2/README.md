### Problem Statement 4: Student Grade Assignment
```sql
Table: Students

CREATE TABLE Students (

(102, 'Priya', 72),
(103, 'Karan', 55),
(104, 'Meera', 40),
(105, 'Anita', 30);
```
Cursor Logic: Use a cursor to loop through each studentâ€™s marks.
Assign grade as per logic:
Marks â‰¥ 80 â†’ Grade 'A'
Marks between 60â€“79 â†’ Grade 'B'
Marks between 40â€“59 â†’ Grade 'C'
Marks < 40 â†’ Grade 'Fail'
